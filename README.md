# Liver-Disease-Prediction


Liver is the most primary part of the body that performs many functions including 
the production of Bile, excretion of bile and bilirubin, metabolism of proteins.

The liver easily gets affected due to intake of alcohol, pain killer tablets, 
food habits, and includes plenty of wired practices.

It is a very challenging task for the common person to predict the disease due to 
lack of awareness.To overcome this issue,in this study,we proposed a machine Learning 
approach using **Logistic Regression** , **Support vector machine** and **Random Forest algorithms**. 

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated with respect to parameters like accuracy, 
sensitivity, precision and specificity then based on these parameters an appropriate 
algorithm is used for disease prediction.

The Liver Disease Prediction dataset consists of records of 584 patients and 11 columns
of different chemicals levels of liver test.
